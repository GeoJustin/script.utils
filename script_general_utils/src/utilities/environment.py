 Name:         glacier_utilities.general_utilities.environment
 Purpose:      This class handles general, repetative, operation common when 
 running tasks which use the arcpy module. This includes importing the module
 (with spatial license if applicable) and creating and cleaning up a scratch 
 workspace.
